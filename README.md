# CS423
From Syllabus:

This course has a specific interest in using AI systems in software products. The course will look at ways to add an AI component to an existing web-based system to enhance the system’s capabilities. The course will take a human-in-the-loop approach, augmenting a human user instead of attempting to replace them. Because of this, issues with explainability must be considered.

Specific topics we will take up are:

- Managing the steps (AKA the workflow) of data science that allow us to transform raw data into production-ready form. The jargony term is MLOps.
- Managing the model-exploration phase to get to a production-ready form. We will study individual models (e.g., Regression, XGBoost, KNN, Neural Nets) and ensembles.
- Putting data and models together in a website that augments a user with AI assistance.
- Giving users the ability to judge AI results by providing effective explanations.

Taught by Prof. Stephen Fickas at University of Oregon.
